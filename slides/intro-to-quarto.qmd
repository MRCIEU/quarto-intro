## Workflow

-   Do an analysis in R

-   Copy results over to an email

-   Send Word document to someone by email

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Quite a manual process to create this
-   Difficult to capture all the output
-   Copying and pasting code - formatting issues
-   Human error
-   Duplicating quite a lot of effort
:::
:::::

## What do we think about this?

-   Simple, non-technical solution
-   Quite manual
-   It doesn't show the full picture
-   It's not reproducible
-   Easily shareable? Easily findable?

## Dynamic documents / literate programming

Integrate:

-   code + the results of that code including tables and figures etc
-   narrative about that code and output e.g. equations
-   bibliographic references
-   multiple coding languages

into one document

e.g. Sweave, RMarkdown / knitr, Jupyter notebooks, Quarto

-   Built from the ground up to be agnostic about programming language
-   Trying to build collaborative workflows with reduced fragmentation

## How would our example look in Quarto?

Create a Quarto document in RStudio

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/clipboard-204058794.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
1.  Create a new Quarto document
2.  Edit / render cycle
3.  Publish it (`quarto publish`)
4.  Share the link
:::
:::::

## Quarto components

1.  Visual vs Source editor / markdown syntax
2.  Inline code and code chunks
3.  Using different languages
4.  Insert a table
5.  Cross reference a figure and add a figure caption
6.  Add a reference and bibliography
7.  Add an interactive plot
8.  Convert to slides

## Sharing the document

A few options e.g.

-   Github pages

-   quarto.pub (`quarto publish`)

## How is it being used?

-   Teaching / practicals e.g. \[MR practical\](<https://github.com/explodecomputer/mr-lecture-practical>)

-   Documenting projects e.g <https://github.com/chorscroft/MR-and-selection>

-   Lab book / blog `quarto create project blog myblog`

-   Websites e.g. [Lifecourse GWAS](https://github.com/lifecourse-gwas/lifecourse-gwas.github.io), [OpenMR](https://github.com/open-mr-project/open-mr-project.github.io)

-   PhD thesis e.g. <https://github.com/mattlee821/bristolthesis>

-   Writing papers? <https://github.com/quarto-journals>
